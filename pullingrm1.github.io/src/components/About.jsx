        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring data scientist interested in applied machine learning
          and artificial intelligence. I love to learn, and problem solve and
          want to help further the future of technology through hard work and
          innovation. I am passionate about helping create interesting and
          useful stories out of data and providing end-to-end data pipelines to
          help people out in their day-to-day lives. I have done research in the
          search and rescue and hydrology domains, both of which I had minimal
          to no experience going into. I enjoy learning about new industries and
          am able to pick up information quickly. Feel free to reach out with
          any questions you may have!

          Outside of programming, I enjoy movies and TV shows (and I love
          discussing them), reading, and spending time outdoors. I try to remain
          very active and play a lot of sports, including basketball,
          volleyball, and pickleball. I play beach volleyball competitively and
          have played in various tournaments both in Colorado and in California.
          I also enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful Colorado mountains.
