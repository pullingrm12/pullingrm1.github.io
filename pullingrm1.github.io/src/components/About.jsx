      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong background in machine
        learning and data analysis. I enjoy transforming complex data into
        actionable insights and building predictive models that drive business
        decisions. My expertise includes Python, R, SQL, and various data
        visualization tools. I thrive in collaborative environments and am
        always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. While I grew
        up in Colorado, my undergraduare studies took me to San Luis Obispo,
        California where I got a bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in
        Statistics. I then returned home and I am currently pursuing a Master's
        in Data Science at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado.

        Outside of programming, I enjoy movies and TV shows (and I love
        discussing them), reading, and spending time outdoors. I try to remain
        very active and play a lot of sports, including basketball, volleyball,
        and pickleball. I play beach volleyball competitively and have played in
        various tournaments both here and in California. I also enjoy hiking and
        exploring the beautiful Colorado mountains.
