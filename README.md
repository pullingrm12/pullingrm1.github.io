# Rhys Pulling Data Portfolio
A personal website/data profile to show off some of the projects I have worked on and am working on. 
I will continue to add to this with new projects as I work on them to expand my portfolio. 

This website has been hosted using GitHub Pages, and can be found using the following link: https://pullingrm12.github.io/pulling_portfolio/.
